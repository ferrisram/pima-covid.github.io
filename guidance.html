<br><br>These measures are not commensurate with current U.S. standards of care, however, they may be implemented during PPE shortages:
<br>
<br><strong>Reuse </strong>refers to the practice of using and removing PPE between multiple patient encounters.
<br>
<br><strong>Extended use</strong> refers to the practice of wearing the same PPE for repeated close contacts without removal. Extended use is favored over reuse as it is expected to involve less touching and therefore lower contamination risk.
<br><br><em><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;High-contact care activities should not involve reuse or extended use of PPE
</strong><br></em>These high-contact resident care activities may increase transfer of pathogens to the hands or clothes of providers:
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;- Dressing<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;- Bathing/showering
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;- Transferring
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;- Providing hygiene
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;- Changing linens
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;- Changing briefs or assisting with toileting
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;- Device care or use
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;- Wound care <br><br><strong>Expired PPE</strong> (gowns, respirators, face masks) may be reused beyond the reported shelf-life after passing visible inspection. Materials that are visibly degraded should be discarded.
<br>
<br><strong>Face Masks</strong>: reuse or extended use of surgical masks may occur when worn in a common area for multiple patient encounters with the same diagnosis or exposure.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;- Some masks received from the Strategic National Stockpile could be expired. These masks &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;may be used, however prioritize for staff who do not provide direct patient care. <br>&nbsp; &nbsp;- For expired masks, please check that the elastic holds mask on securely.
<br>
<br><strong>N95 respirators</strong>: reuse or extended use has been authorized by the CDC, and a checklist for optimizing the supply of respirators can be found here:&nbsp;<u><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/checklist-n95-strategy.html">https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/checklist-n95-strategy.html</a></u><br>&nbsp; &nbsp;- In the event of low supplies, respirators that are not NIOSH-approved, or even not performing &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;adequately for healthcare delivery, can be used.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;- Acceptable methods for decontamination and reuse of N95 masks can be found <u><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/ppe-strategy/decontamination-reuse-respirators.html">here</a>.</u><br><br><strong>Gowns</strong>: reuse or extended use of cloth isolation gowns, which are usually made of polyester-cotton fabrics, may be safely laundered according to routine <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/infectioncontrol/guidelines/environmental/background/laundry.html#g6"><u>procedures</u></a> and reused.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;- Extended use of isolation gowns (disposable or cloth) may occur such that the same gown is &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;worn by the same staff member when interacting with more than one patient, if those patients &nbsp; &nbsp;are known to be infected with the same infectious disease, and they are housed in the same &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;location (i.e. COVID-19 patients residing in an isolation cohort).
<br>- This can be considered only if there are no additional co-infectious diagnoses transmitted by &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;contact (such as C. difficile) among patients.
<br>- If the gown becomes visibly soiled, it must be removed and discarded as per <u><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/npptl/pdfs/PPE-Sequence-508.pdf">usual practices</a>.</u>&nbsp;<br></p>

<br>
<br>Facemasks are generally preferred over cloth face coverings for staff as facemasks offer both source control and protection for the wearer against exposure from others. 
<br>
<br>Facemasks should be prioritized for staff, and then for patients with symptoms of COVID-19 (as supply allows). 
<br>
<br>Cloth face coverings should NOT be worn instead of a respirator or facemask if more than source control is required.
<br>
<br>Some staff whose job duties do not require PPE (e.g., clerical personnel) might continue to wear their cloth face covering for source control while in the healthcare facility. 
<br>
<br>Other staff (e.g., nurses, physicians) might wear their cloth face covering for part of the day when not engaged in direct patient care activities, only switching to a respirator or facemask when PPE is required. 
<br>
<br>To avoid risking self-contamination, staff should consider continuing to wear their respirator or facemask (see “extended use” above) instead of intermittently switching back to their cloth face covering. 
<br>
<br>Staff should remove their respirator or facemask and put on their cloth face covering when leaving the facility at the end of their shift.  They should also be instructed that if they must touch or adjust their facemask or cloth face covering they should perform hand hygiene immediately before and after.
<br><br>Of note, N95s with an exhaust valve might not provide source control.&nbsp;<br></p>

<br>
<br>Make PPE accessible outside of the resident room and in resident care areas.
<br>
<br>Prioritize gowns for aerosol generating procedures, care activities where splashes and sprays are anticipated, and high-contact resident care activities (see list above).
<br>
<br>Start extended use of eye and face protection (respirator or facemask).
<br>
<br>Staff removes only gloves and gown (if used) and performs hand hygiene between patients while continuing to wear the same eye protection and respirator or facemask.
<br>
<br>Staff must not touch their eye protection and respirator or facemask.
<br>
<br>Remove eye protection and the respirator or facemask and perform hand hygiene if they become damaged or soiled, and when leaving the unit.
<br>
<br>If your facility is concerned about a potential or imminent shortage of PPE, please contact your Pima County Health Department liaison to discuss your supply of the PPE item and projected shortage date.&nbsp;<br></p>
